### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **16-year-old self-taught full stack developer** from Sri Lanka and started coding in 2021.

I specialize in building clean, scalable, and modern web applications using:

- **Frontend**
`React` • `Next.js` • `Tailwind CSS` • `TypeScript` • `Framer Motion`

- **Backend**
`Node.js` • `Express.js` • `REST APIs`

- **Databases**
`MySQL` • `MongoDB (Mongoose)` • `PostgreSQL (Prisma)`

- **Tools & Dev Experience**
`Git` • `GitHub` • `VS Code` • `Postman` • `Figma` • `Vercel` • `Netlify`

I learn by building, and I don't follow trends blindly — I pick stable, future-ready tech and mastering it deeply these days.
