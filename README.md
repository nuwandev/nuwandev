### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **16-year-old self-taught developer** from Sri Lanka, passionate about web development and building cool things with code. I started learning 3+ years ago and right now I'm fully focused on becoming a strong full-stack developer.  

Currently, I'm following the **ICM Java Course at iCET Institute** while learning modern full-stack technologies on my own.

My learning style:
- 🧠 Understanding the **core fundamentals** before jumping into frameworks  
- ✨ Writing **clean, readable code** that makes sense  
- 🚀 Building **real projects** to truly learn  

> _"Good code is its own best documentation."_ — Steve McConnell

- Clean, responsive web apps with React & Tailwind  
- Backend servers using Node.js, Express, and REST APIs  
- Integrate databases like MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL  
- Work with Git and manage real-world codebases on GitHub
